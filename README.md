# CUCSV
## Cucsv stands for "Create User (from) CSV" and is a PHP Wordpress Plugin that creates Users from a CSV File provided to it.
- in /assets you will find both a ´´´Test.CSV´´´ and ´´´Output.CSV´´´.
- ´´´Test.CSV´´´ CAN be deleted but it is recommended that you keep both files for optimal functionality

## To Start using the Plugin, put it in your "Plugins" Folder in Wordpress
